Thank you for being interested in Mineload!

Mineload is a system to track the status of a minecraft server using Bukkit
using XML generated with a server Plugin.

The files contained here need to be uploaded to a PHP enabled
webserver.

Functions your server will need:
*MySQL
*fopen(), fwrite(), socket() - many shared hosting companies disable these
 functions making php code useless. Bastards.
*Bukkit server.
*Ports 2500 forwarded if your server is behind a firewall.

To install simply upload this folder to your webserver and navigate to
www.your-awesome-minecraft-server.xxx/mineload/install

This will begin the web installer.

Please ensure the mineload/config folder is writable eg chmod 777 config
but then change it back to something reasonable afterwards eg chmod 644 config

DELETE the install folder after it has completed for security reasons.

It would be awesome if you checked out the source code, send bugs/issues 
or pull requests to my GitHub account: github.com/timatooth/Mineload
